      "description": "The development of a new polyclinic in Faqous, northern Egypt, marks the first major project in the charity’s My Health programme, which was created following extensive evaluation of regional healthcare facilities in Egypt. The plan is to construct and equip four international hospitals and three healthcare centres, in areas of greatest medical need. Having opened Faqous, work is now underway on our first international hospital in Qous, with the main building work complete, and fit-out underway. Each development will offer specialist support, tailored to the particular health requirements of the local population. In addition to Faqous, sites are also being developed in Aswan, Qena, Menia, Giza and Behira in Egypt. A number of the sites are already in construction phase. The completed Faqous project has created an impressive healthcare centre, providing a day surgery centre, outpatient facility and radiology services in a deprived, rural part of the country, where thousands of residents are unable to pay for healthcare. Together with planning and construction, through trusted regional contractors, we are also developing strategic partnerships on the ground, and are engaged in training programmes to guarantee that each new development has the skilled staff to ensure that it is fully operational from day one. As a result of the generosity of supporters, millions of people will benefit from the medical services which will be delivered through the seven new centres in the programme. The ‘My Health’ programme is supported by His Holiness, Pope Tawardros III, leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church.",

Our first shipment to Cairo’s largest public hospital, Om El Masriyeen, was dispensed by the hospital in 2017 for the treatment of people who simply would not have been able to access medicine if it were not for our efforts and those who support us. Additional shipments have since been received by Cairo’s Children’s Cancer Hospital.",

St Mark Universal Copts Care supported the group to enable it to roll-out more workshops for school children, youth groups, and groups such as vulnerable women and children with autism. Designed to be fun and engaging, the workshops helped to improve mental health conditions in those people living with a range of psychological issues. At a time when depression is set to become the UK’s second most common medical condition, Project Happiness proved a timely and effective support mechanism.",
